**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: January 3, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Start re-developing my personal website with [nextjs](https://github.com/zeit/next.js).

**Thoughts:** Really excited. I know something about the universal js used by next.js and I really want to know more about.  
Currently the experience is pretty good.
I'm developing kinda a static website for know, without the use of React.  
I'm also making some experiments with CSS animations.
