# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Start re-developing my personal website with [nextjs](https://github.com/zeit/next.js).

**Thoughts:** Really excited. I know something about the universal js used by next.js and I really want to know more about.  
Currently the experience is pretty good.
I'm developing kinda a static website for know, without the use of React.  
I'm also making some experiments with CSS animations.

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Progress with Nextjs. Updating to 2.0.0-beta and adding <Link> (next/prefetch) component for prefetching pages and activate client-side routing. Also some fixes.

**Thoughts:** Nice, only thing I have to struggle with is the scoped CSS. Some JSX and compilation errors to handle... That's a reason I prefer Polymer rather than React, but don't blame me please :D

### Day 2: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Little break from my website and having fun with Web Speech APIs.

**Thoughts:** Incredibly easy to understand, I think I have to build something on top of it and a Raspberry PI :rocket:

### Day 3: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Speech API prototype and put a demo online (thanks [now-static](https://zeit.co/blog/now-static)).  
Get back on my website with the last adjustment before the final deploy.

**Thoughts:** Is really easy to deploy live testing with ***now*** and I'm seriously thinking about get their premium plan.  
On other hand, I need to revisit the `next/prefetch` feature of **next.js**, maybe I need to write a real React component to better testing it.

### Day 4: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today is the day of [vue.js](https://vuejs.org). I'm trying the [vue-cli] for building a simple dashboard of [now](https://zeit.co/now) deployments.  
I also fixed my little VPS to put live my godev.space website.

**Thoughts:** The first impression is good. I need a deeper knowledge of the framework before talking about pros and cons. I really need to setup testing.

### Day 5: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Realized I couldn't simply call the Zeit's Now APIs, I'm building a simple Hapi.js server for serving the web app in Vue.js and also to correctly call the Zeit's APIs.

**Thoughts:** I little disappointed that I can't call directly the Zeit's APIs but I understand their reasons. By the way it's good get back and practice with Hapi.js
